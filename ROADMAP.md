Monsters-Inc Styled Simulation

So, on the software side, the thought is to create a sort of monsters inc styled door series of 'pocket universes' that act a bit differently from each other.

The main area might be fairly plain, with a [simple door](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/monstersincmovies/images/0/08/Boo%27sdoor2.png/revision/latest?cb=20150915042057) with a decoration and a knob to change a symbol on the door or the door's entire design itself.

Things get interesting when you open the door, for example there might be a door with a bubble on it, when you open that door a bunch of bubbles start wafting through. Or there might be a door with a wind icon on it, and it might open itself if you get close without actually touching anything, perhaps to reveal an entire tornado with flying people/houses/wizard of oz references.

[Rick and Morty VR talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aqIbeQQL8c), this might have some interesting things to implement regarding portals/mirrors

At the end of the game, users might see a graph of their heart rate throughout the simulation along with milestone events such as opening a "scary" door
